Goals:

- Iterative Project Life Cycle
- Hybrid Life Cycle
- Extended Project Life Cycle
<pre>
  Linear Approach
  - Concept : Initiation
  - Definition : Planning
  - Deployment : Execution
  - Transition : Closure
</pre>

<pre>
  Iterative Approach
  : Agile
  - Pre-Project : Initiation
  - Feasibility and Foundation
  - Evolutionary Development
  - Deployment
  - Post-project

  Iterations are applied when we have "Goals" but no clear "means of achieving"
  But rapid deployment of partial solutions gives back fast feedback

<pre>
Hybrid Approach
    Adding iterative elements to ‘predictive’ projects can enhance deployment in stages, support the generation of insights, 
    underpin the realisation of an early benefit stream and validate some of the ideas much earlier in the cycle.
